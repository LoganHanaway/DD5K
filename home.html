					<h2>Michael, age 44</h2>
					<p>"Every year my daughter and I look forward to running in the Dad & Daughter 5K. It's something
						special just for us. We enjoy doing practice runs in the weeks leading up to the event, and
						sharing that special feeling of accomplishment when we cross the finish line at the race. And we
						both love the festivities before and after the race. She looks forward to creating with the
						markers and glitter, and I enjoy getting free buffalo wings! We also like to wear our matching
						shirts all year round! It's one of the highlights of our year."</p>
