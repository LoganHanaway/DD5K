					<h3>Dad and Daughter 5K</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/susan1.webp" alt="" /></span>This 5K was born out of a
						book I wrote about my dad, Run the Race: A Fatherâ€™s Legacy of Life
						Lessons. On a summer vacation sitting on the beach in North Carolina, a friend suggested I write
						a book about my dad because of all the great stories I would tell. So, for cathartic reasons I
						did write this book. The book is how he taught me to run long distances. But, in reality he
						taught me to run the real races of life, too. I still run today and it has been a saving grace
						for me.</p>

					<p>In 2014, I started a local 5K Run/Walk in Kansas City, Missouri named Dad and Daughter 5K. It was
						because of my book and a Boston radio host suggesting that I start a 5K in Kansas City and go
						national. Over the years, it has grown exponentially and I do hope and pray of taking it
						nationwide. </p>
					<p>My 5K is a 501 C and we give our proceeds to Phoenix Family. This organization is a life changer
						for children, families and the elderly. They provide social services and housing for the
						underserved in KC. They also provide children with the Hike Reading Program after school which
						was started by Trent Green Family Foundation. I am a teacher and counselor and thankful that
						Phoenix Family helps prevent human beings from going homeless and provide such an amazing
						literacy program for the kiddos and set them up for a successful future!</p>

						pages.</p>
					<p>Keep running the race,</p>
